# Introduction

Pagine is an high-performance content-driven website generator based on template processing.

[**Astro**](https://astro.build) is really a powerful framework for building content-driven website!

It fits my needs perfectly! At this point, four months of development of Pagine were suspended.

After that, I thought about integrating Starlark as embedded programming language, but this still couldn't match the strong competitiveness of the Node.js NPM ecosystem. ðŸ˜‡

If the project has a change/chance to be restarted next time, it will definitely/must be **COMPLETELY DIFFERENT** from now. ðŸ˜‰
